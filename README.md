Learnings:

Through smaller steps and context building, it is possible to get results equivelent to the larger models with smaller models.
- Saves money, energy, speeds up responses

AI Services will have to be very specific
- The prompt chain, context building, and back and forth is very specific

Human Reinforcement Learning Requires Experts
- Both the people writing the prompt examples for supervised learning and the people ranking responses to build the train reward model should be experts and only working within their domain.
